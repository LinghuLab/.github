Welcome to the GitHub of the Linghu Lab (Spatial Biodynamics Lab) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Our lab develops and applies cutting-edge molecular and imaging technologies to enable scalable, multiplexed interrogation of cell physiology in the living brain, to ultimately decode the neurobiological principles underlying memory, computation, and aging.


🤝 **Join Us**

We are actively looking for highly motivated Postdocs, PhD students, and Technicians to join our interdisciplinary team at the intersection of the Medical School, Neuroscience Institute, and Biomedical Engineering.
